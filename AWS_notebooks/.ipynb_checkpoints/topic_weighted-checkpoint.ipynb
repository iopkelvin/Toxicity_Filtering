And Xi is a great man for taking advantage of the U.S.\\nDoes Trump think he is dealing with \"Viny,\" one of the mobsters he hung with with back in his casino days? That Xi is stupid and would roll over for some chap flattery? The Chinese respect strength, not submission.\\nTrump went to China as a supplicant, needing help on N.Korea and trade. In Chinese terms, he lost face big time on this trip.</th>\n",
